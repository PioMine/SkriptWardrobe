Instructions:

/wardhelp - help with wardrobe. can be also executed by clicking slot 8 (red dye) in the wardrobe

Slot 8 - also known as red dye named credits. this displays credits in lore and when clicked executes /wardhelp

Slot 0 - Discord button. also known as light blue dye. shows a fancy Discord text (when clicked takes you to https://discord.gg/8GTaWeYXe4)

Empty Slots - put armor in. to take it out, use right mouse button. 

Blue Dye - also known as the Reset button. it takes all pieces of armor off. works only when the wardrobe armor is equipped. DISCLAIMER: when you are equipping wardrobe armor please be naked (no armor) because it will get deleted.

Green Borders - does nothing. just for visual effect

End of instructions
